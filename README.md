# Authentication App

#### This app was created following tutorial series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uONz0lEWft0. It's made using MEAN stack.

##### So far...
- set up the backend Express server with dependencies from Mongoose, BCryptjs, Passport, etc. 
- specified routes such as /register, /profile, etc.
- completed /register post to sign up a new user, and encrypt passwords with bcrypt
- implemented Passport.js and JWT for authentication (Users will be able to register with the API and get a token to be able to submit to protected routes)
- started front end development with Angular CLI

###### Note:
node_modules folder not included. Please run `npm install` to create it.

###### To run this build, execute `npm start` or `nodemon`. Make sure to have MongoDB running in the background.
